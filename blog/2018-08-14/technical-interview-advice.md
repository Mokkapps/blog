In my previous company I got the opportunity to be one of about 20 so called "candidate interviewers" which participate in our technical interviews which is an essential part of this company's application procedure. I participated in about 30 interviews and learned a lot during this time and I want to share my experiences with you. In my opinion there are some few rules which are important to succeed in any technical interview.

## Have a "good" CV and resume

These are the first documents your interviewer will review. I mainly checked the documents looking for these marks:

#### Is it well structured? 
My recommendation: Use a [LaTeX template](https://www.latextemplates.com/cat/curricula-vitae) and [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) for writing and publishing LaTeX files.

#### Are there any spell checking errors? 
Run a spell checker over your application documents before you send it to HR department. I often asked myself why people do not use technical assistance like spell checkers to avoid these kind of unnecessary hurdles during the application procedure.  

#### What are his/her main skills?
Please use a rating for your technical skills. Can you guess what such a list should represent:

```
Programming languages: Java, Python, JavaScript, C++
```

Does this mean that you know Java the most or that you have the same knowledge for all languages? I personally prefer a rated list like:

```
Programming languages

    Java:       Expert
    Python:     Intermediate
    JavaScript: Novice
```

or alternatively a graphical representation like

#### What buzzwords could be mentioned just to have a better CV without having real knowledge in this topic?
Be prepared for some questions about tools/frameworks/libraries you mention in your CV or resume. Interviewer could pick some of them and ask little questions to see if you really have experience using it.

## Prepare yourself

This sounds stupid but is essential. I would say that more than 30 percent of my interview partners were poorly prepared. 

For example, if you apply for a Java developer job you should know the fundamentals of Java programming language. 

In general, I recommend to ask the internet search engine of your choice and you will find a ton of possible interview questions:

Summarized, learn your favorite programming language and deep dive into all possible aspects of it. 

## Apply for everything that interests you and do not fear failures

Believe me: As an interviewer you can sense if someone has experiences in technical interviews or if it is his/her first interview.

My recommendation: Go to as many job interviews as you can. Each time you will gain experience and get more confident. Even getting rejected from an job application will let you gain valuable experience in the process of job interviews.

## Be proud of your code

If you have some project or only code snippet you are proud of then add it to your application. As an interviewer, it can really be helpful to see some code from the person.

In my opinion, it is positive to see if a person participates in open source projects, writes blog posts, publishes YouTube videos or has an active Twitter channel. 

A good example is for example again [WesBos](http://wesbos.com). He has a very interesting Twitter channel, is an active YouTuber, has his own product (his courses website), an active GitHub profile, produces a podcast and talks at conferences. Of course, this is special but as you can see this is very impressive for interviewers. 

So get yourself out there and make yourself interesting for other people.

## Talk about yourself and not about others

Talk about the decisions you have made in projects as this is the most interesting part for an interviewer. This way the interviewer can see if someone is able to make a decision and pretend it against others.

Otherwise it does not put you in a good light if you talk about decisions of others that you accepted and will always accept without giving contra

## Learn to handwrite code in front of people

This is a really essential skill that you should train. Take some coding challenges and practice them on a whiteboard or flip chart. You should feel comfortable in it as this can happy in any technical interview.

Most of them time you will have to solve any kind of algorithmic problem. I would suggest to follow these steps in such a situation:

* Take your time and think about a solution (do not start to immediately write code)
* Find a brute force solution and talk about it's [Big O notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation)
* Try to find a more efficient solution and talk about the improved Big O notation
* Write down the steps of your solution in clear text. This is helpful for the interviewer and the "coder" to see if the proposed solution is correct
* Write down your code
* Test your written code with different parameters and check if it works
* Talk about possible code improvements and unit tests

## Be a specialist in a certain topic

You should be able to describe your profession in 1-2 short sentences. This is helpful for interviewers to see your technical focus and you will probably be mainly asked about stuff you are really good at.

Bad example:
`Software Developer`

Good example (from [Wesbos](http://wesbos.com)):
`Designer, Developer & Entrepreneur making the web an awesome place.`

Reading the second sentence gives me a very clear picture of this developer in only one sentence.

## Be able to draw project architectures

You should be able to draw a high-level project architecture of a project you worked with in an understandable but technical correct way.

An example for a complex project:

## Be passionate

Let the interviewer know that software development is your passion. Talk about your most favorite features of your preferred programming language, tool or frameworks. Let the interviewer know that you keep yourself up to date and you love to write code.
